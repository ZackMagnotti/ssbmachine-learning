# SSBMachine Learning

Use Deep Learning to analyse the variety and similarities between playstyles in Super Smash Bros Melee.

## Part 1: Character Detection
  
Use a Convolutional Neural Network to predict a player's character selection based on the raw inputs from that player's controller.

### Model

foo

### Results

bar

## Part 2: Player Detection

Use Transfer Learning to train a neural network to predict *who* is holding the controller, based only on the raw inputs from that controller.

### Model

foobar

### Results
